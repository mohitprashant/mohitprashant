### Hello there 👋 

#### A coffee enthusiast by day ☼ and an AI researcher by night ☾

I am currently PhD student at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. My work is focused on machine learning safety and probabilistic guarantees for reinforcement learning using the PAC framework. As a sidenote, I enjoy competitive programming in my free time and I have a fondness for applying learning-based techniques to automate and discover solution strategies/algorithms to game environments.



- ⚙️ I use daily: `Python3`, `C++`, `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`, `Java`
- 🌍 I'm mostly active within the **ML Research Subreddit**
- 💬 `ping` me about **research ideas**, **RL agent development**, **safe ML training/verification**, **hot takes on DnD5e**
- :collision: Currently updating my website and project repositories, `Please Hang Tight`
